Dark Souls Tower Defence

<p>
Settings can be changed Game.class and Player.class.
</p>
<p>
In Game.class, set the rate higher to increate rate and smaller (0) to have insane spawn rate.
</p>
<p>
Player starts with insane 40000$. This is for debug reasons and left as that. Change the value to
500$ for extra challenge in Player.scala!
